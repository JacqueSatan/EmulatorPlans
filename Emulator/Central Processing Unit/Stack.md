# Stack
The stack can be accessed by the [[Interpreter]] to store temporary values, like functions arguments.

The stack can store 16 different 32 bits wide values. Only the last value added can be accessed. Stack values can't be modified.

Please refer to [[Interpreter#Instructions]] `0x05` and `0x06` for more informations.
